This code allows the user to  create a train schedule by entering the train's name, destination, first train arrival (in military time) and frequency of arrival.
The information gathered is used to create a train reader board that informs the user of the trains expected arrival time and how long until the train arrives.
This program uses moment.js to identify the current time and calculate the time to the next arrival.
